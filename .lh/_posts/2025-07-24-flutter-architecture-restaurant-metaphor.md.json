Right, as customers we need to order food, the waiter records our request and passes it to the kitchen, the kitchen receives the order and delegates it to the appropriate chef based on the dish type! Once the chef finishes cooking, we get to enjoy our meal! So let's imagine Flutter's process works like ordering food at a restaurant!\n \n-Just a heads up, this might seem like a silly comparison at first, but trust me, by the end of this article you'll never look at `FlutterTextInputPlugin.mm` the same way again. (And yes, that's a real file name - I know it sounds like someone fell asleep on their keyboard!)\n-\n **Customer (iOS Developer) orders â†’ Waiter (Framework) takes the order â†’ Kitchen (Engine) cooks â†’ Customer enjoys the meal (System Menu)**\n \n-![Flutter Restaurant Metaphor - Customer to Kitchen Flow](/images/flutter-restaurant-metaphor.png)\n-*The complete flow: Customer (iOS Developer) â†’ Waiter (Flutter Framework) â†’ Kitchen (Flutter Engine) â†’ System Menu*\n-\n ## The Architecture Flow\n \n Here's a visual representation of how the system works:\n \n ```\n-`[iOS App Developer]`\n-    â†“ (uses `TextField`/`CupertinoTextField`)\n-`[Flutter Framework - Dart]`\n-    â†“ (Platform Channel: `\"ContextMenu.showSystemContextMenu\"`)\n-`[Flutter Engine - Objective-C]`\n-    â†“ (`FlutterPlatformPlugin.mm` â†’ `FlutterTextInputPlugin.mm`)\n-`[iOS Native System Menu]`\n-    â†“ (`UIMenuController`)\n-`[User sees the menu!]`\n+[iOS App Developer]\n+    â†“ (uses TextField/CupertinoTextField)\n+[Flutter Framework - Dart]\n+    â†“ (Platform Channel: \"ContextMenu.showSystemContextMenu\")\n+[Flutter Engine - Objective-C]\n+    â†“ (FlutterPlatformPlugin.mm â†’ FlutterTextInputPlugin.mm)\n+[iOS Native System Menu]\n+    â†“ (UIMenuController)\n+[User sees the menu!]\n ```\n \n ## Step 1: Customer Places Order (iOS App Development Layer)\n \n Most developers use `TextField` or `CupertinoTextField` to create editable text fields. But under the hood, both of these widgets rely on a core component: **`EditableText`**.\n \n Developers can customize the menu that pops up after long-pressing a text field through properties like `TextField.contextMenuBuilder` or `CupertinoTextField.contextMenuBuilder`. It's like a customer telling the waiter: \"I don't want the default meal! I want to customize my order!\"\n \n-On iOS, if developers **don't customize the menu**, `TextField` defaults to using a built-in menu called **`SystemContextMenu`**. Its job is very specific - just taking orders. It doesn't cook the menu itself, it's just a messenger. It's like the customer telling the waiter: \"Hey, I'll just take the default menu, let the iOS kitchen prepare a standard native menu!\" (Because let's be honest, sometimes we're too lazy to customize everything, and that's totally fine!)\n+On iOS, if developers **don't customize the menu**, `TextField` defaults to using a built-in menu called **`SystemContextMenu`**. Its job is very specific - just taking orders. It doesn't cook the menu itself, it's just a messenger. It's like the customer telling the waiter: \"Hey, I'll just take the default menu, let the iOS kitchen prepare a standard native menu!\"\n \n ## Step 2: Waiter Takes Order and Passes to Kitchen (From Framework to Engine)\n \n-Now the \"waiter\" (Framework) has received the instruction to \"show native menu\". They need to accurately convey this instruction to the \"kitchen\" (Engine). This communication process uses a tool called **Platform Channels** (Flutter's mechanism for Dart-native communication). Think of it as a walkie-talkie, specifically managed by `text_input.dart`, for communication between Dart code (in Framework) and native code (Objective-C, in Engine).\n+Now the \"waiter\" (Framework) has received the instruction to \"show native menu\".

Think of it as a walkie-talkie, specifically managed by text_input.dart, for communication between Dart code (in Framework) and native code (Objective-C, in Engine).\n \n 1. `SystemContextMenu` uses a controller called `SystemContextMenuController` (manages native iOS menu display)\n 2. Through platform channels, it sends a message named `\"ContextMenu.showSystemContextMenu\"`\n \n-This message is like the waiter shouting into the walkie-talkie: \"Table 7 wants the salmon!\" (Except in our case it's more like \"Table UITextField wants the SystemContextMenu!\" - not as appetizing, I know.)\n+This message is like the waiter shouting into the walkie-talkie: \"Table 7 wants the salmon!\"\n \n ## Step 3: Kitchen Prepares the Dish (Engine Layer)\n \n-Now the message reaches the \"kitchen floor manager\" through the walkie-talkie â€” `FlutterPlatformPlugin.mm`, which is the \"first stop\" in the engine for receiving all platform messages. It's super busy, receiving all kinds of instructions (not just text-related). Think of it as that one manager who's running around with three phones, a clipboard, and somehow still knows exactly where everything goes.

Just like how a popular dish might disappear from a restaurant menu and customers complain, iOS users noticed that the **Live Text** option (iOS's native OCR feature that lets you extract text from images) disappeared from text field menus after a Secure Paste update. (Yeah, sometimes fixing one thing breaks another - welcome to software development!)\n+Let me share a real story from the Flutter kitchen! Just like how a popular dish might disappear from a restaurant menu and customers complain, iOS users noticed that the **Live Text** option (a feature that lets you extract text from images) disappeared from text field menus after a Flutter update.\n \n-Here's the key difference from other menu items: Live Text is like a dish that's actually prepared by iOS's central kitchen, not our Flutter kitchen. We just need to make sure it's on the menu and know how to order it!\n-\n ### The Problem: Missing Dish on the Menu\n In PR [#170969](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/170969), I had to add the Live Text option back to the iOS system context menu. It's like customers saying: \"Hey, where did my favorite Live Text dish go? We want it back!\"\n \n ### The Solution: Recipe Development\n \n Just like adding a new dish requires coordination between the dining room and kitchen, here's how I fixed it:\n \n #### 1. Update the Menu (Framework Side)\n-First, I created a new menu item class in the Framework. Actually, let me show you the full recipe:\n-\n-**The Menu Item** (what customers see):\n+First, I created a new menu item class in the Framework:\n ```dart\n-// This is what appears on the menu\n-class IOSSystemContextMenuItemLiveText extends IOSSystemContextMenuItem {\n-  const IOSSystemContextMenuItemLiveText();\n-}\n-```\n-\n-**The Order Ticket** (what gets sent to the kitchen):\n-```dart\n-// This is what the waiter writes down and sends to the kitchen\n-final class IOSSystemContextMenuItemDataLiveText extends IOSSystemContextMenuItemData {\n+// Like adding a new item to the restaurant's menu board\n+class IOSSystemContextMenuItemDataLiveText extends IOSSystemContextMenuItemData {\n   const IOSSystemContextMenuItemDataLiveText();\n-  \n-  @override\n-  String get _jsonType => 'captureTextFromCamera';\n-  // This tells the kitchen: \"Customer wants the camera text scanning special!\"\n+  // This tells the waiter: \"We now serve Live Text!\"\n }\n ```\n \n-**Adding it to the Menu Board**:\n-```dart\n-// The restaurant only serves this dish if they have the right equipment!\n-if (editableTextState.liveTextInputEnabled) \n-  const IOSSystemContextMenuItemLiveText(),\n-```\n-\n-See how it all fits together? The Framework checks if Live Text is available (like checking if the kitchen has the right ingredients), then adds it to the menu!\n-\n #### 2. Kitchen Preparation (Engine Side)\n-Then in the kitchen (`FlutterTextInputPlugin.mm`), here's the fun part - I actually SIMPLIFIED the recipe! The previous chef was overthinking it with unnecessary checks. \n-\n-**Checking if the Kitchen Can Make This Dish**:\n+Then in the kitchen (`FlutterTextInputPlugin.mm`), I had to teach the chef how to prepare this dish:\n ```objc\n-// First, we check if the kitchen has the right equipment (iOS 15.0+)\n-- (BOOL)canPerformAction:(SEL)action withSender:(id)sender {\n-    if (action == @selector(captureTextFromCamera:)) {\n-        if (@available(iOS 15.0, *)) {\n-            return YES;  // Yes chef, we can make this!\n-        }\n-        return NO;  // Sorry, our kitchen doesn't have this equipment\n-    }\n-    // ... check other menu items ...\n+// The chef now knows how to make Live Text when ordered\n+if ([item.type isEqualToString:kIOSActionTypeLiveText]) {\n+  // Prepare the Live Text dish\n+  return [self liveTextAction];\n }\n ```\n \n-**Actually Making the Dish**:\n-```objc\n-// When the order comes in, we just let iOS's master chef handle it!\n-- (void)captureTextFromCamera:(id)sender {\n-    if (@available(iOS 15.0, *)) {\n-        [super captureTextFromCamera:sender];\n-        // That's it! We're not reinventing the wheel here\n-    }\n-}\n-```\n-\n-The beauty? We're not implementing OCR or camera functionality - that's all iOS's job! We're just the middleman saying \"Hey iOS, the customer wants your Live Text special!\" This is different from features like Look Up where we might need to do more processing. For Live Text, we literally just pass the order to iOS's master chef and get out of the way. Sometimes the best code is the code you don't write!\n-\n #### 3. Serving the Dish\n The beauty of this fix? Once both the Framework (waiter) and Engine (kitchen) knew about Live Text, iOS users could once again enjoy this feature in their text field menus!\n \n-And here's the kicker - the whole fix was actually about REMOVING complexity, not adding it. Sometimes the best code is the code you delete. (Don't tell my manager I said that!)\n \n-#### 4. The Return Journey (When Users Click Live Text)\n-But wait, there's more! When a user actually clicks the Live Text button:\n-1. **iOS takes the order directly**: The click on the native menu goes straight to iOS\n-2. **Kitchen gets to work**: `captureTextFromCamera:` is called in our Engine code (which simply calls `[super captureTextFromCamera:sender]` - remember, we simplified this!)\n-3. **Special delivery**: iOS opens the camera with text recognition\n-4. **Kitchen updates the waiter**: Even though iOS handled the camera directly, the Framework still gets notified of the result\n-5. **Happy customer**: The recognized text flows back through the Engine â†’ Framework â†’ Your app!\n-\n-It's like ordering a special dish that requires the chef to come out and prepare it at your table, but the waiter still needs to write it down in the order book to keep track of everything!\n-\n-This real-world example shows exactly how the restaurant metaphor works in practice. Every new feature or bug fix in Flutter follows this same pattern: customer request â†’ waiter (Framework) â†’ kitchen (Engine) â†’ happy customer!\n-\n ## Bonus: What Happens When Users Click?
