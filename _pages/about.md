## 👋 Hey there! I'm Jing Shao.

I'm a graduate student in **Computer Software Engineering** at [**Northeastern University – College of Engineering**](https://coe.northeastern.edu/), specializing in **machine learning**, **multi-modal model safety**, and **end-to-end AI system development**.

My research focuses on **making generative and embodied AI systems more trustworthy, robust, and efficient, aiming for reliable performance in real-world scenarios**

Beyond academia, I contributed to a **stealth-stage AI startup**, developing **AI-powered audio systems** and integrating **ML models** into scalable infrastructure for **real-time interaction**. I'm also a **Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025** contributor, working on **secure Flutter engine integration** for the open-source community.

**📌 Actively seeking opportunities in:**
- **Industry**: Fall 2025 internship or full-time roles in ML Engineering/Applied AI.
- **Academia**: Research Assistant positions or Fall 2026 PhD programs.

✨ [My CV can be found here!](http://jingshao-code.github.io) 
Feel free to reach out or connect!!

[Jailbreak-AudioBench: In-Depth Evaluation and Analysis of Jailbreak Threats for Large Audio Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13772)

- **Academic Impact**: This work introduces Jailbreak-AudioBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating audio-based jailbreak threats against LALMs. By systematically exploiting audio-specific hidden semantics—such as tone, intonation, background noise, and emotion—we uncover previously unreported vulnerabilities in multimodal AI safety. This research lays the foundation for future work in understanding and defending against audio manipulation attacks in LALMs.
- **Practical Impact**: Our benchmark reveals critical security vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LALMs, with models like SALMONN-7B reaching an 85.1% Attack Success Rate under systematic query-based attacks. These findings have direct implications for real-world systems, including voice assistants, customer service bots, and in-vehicle audio interfaces, offering actionable guidance for building safer and more robust audio AI systems.

[Energy-based Active Learning for Bringing Beam-induced Domain Gap for 3D Object Detection](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3636534.3694723)

- **Academic Impact**: This work proposes an energy-based active learning framework to close the domain gap between 64-beam and 16-beam LiDARs, enabling knowledge transfer with minimal labeled data.
- **Practical Impact**: Our method significantly reduces annotation cost and achieves high-performance 3D object detection on 16-beam LiDAR with only a small portion of labeled samples.
