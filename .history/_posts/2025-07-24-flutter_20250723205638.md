Your First Step to Contributing: A Guide to Building the Flutter¬†Engine

This guide walks you through setting up and building the Flutter Engine from source, targeting iOS devices, simulators, and the macOS host environment. It also shows how to integrate the custom engine with a test Flutter app using the Flutter tool or Xcode.

üíª Tested on

This guide was tested on the following device:

- Device: MacBook Air 15" (M2, 2023)
- Chip: Apple M2 (ARM64)
- Memory: 8GB
- macOS: Sequoia 15.5

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your macOS version is up-to-date and compatible with the latest Xcode version.  
```

**If you are located in mainland China, please read the Appendix before proceeding!!!**

Phase 1: Environment Setup and Prerequisites

### step1: **Required System Dependencies**  (from `Setting-up-the-Engine-development-environment.md`)

On macOS: install latest Xcode

Make sure your system includes the following tools:

```bash
brew install git python3 ninja
```

### step2: Clone flutter engine repo & depot_tools (from `engine/README.md`)

Next, clone both the main Flutter repository and Google's `depot_tools`. We are grouping all download steps together for efficiency.

**Note:** In this guide, all repositories are cloned into the home directory (`~`). All subsequent paths in this guide assume this location as their base. Please replace it with your own path.

```bash
# Clone the main Flutter repository (contains SDK and engine source)
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter 

# Clone depot_tools, which contains the gclient script
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git 
```

step3: PATH Setup

Here is a quick explanation of each path's role:

**depot_tools:** This path adds the `gclient` command, which is essential for syncing the engine's dependencies. Flutter¬†Engine relies on **depot_tools** to fetch Dart¬†SDK and third‚Äëparty code via¬†`gclient`.

**Flutter SDK (`flutter/bin`):** **For Application Development.** This path is for the standard `flutter` command you use every day. Its purpose is to build, run, and manage your **applications**.

**Flutter Engine Tools (`engine/src/flutter/bin`):** **For Engine Development.** This path points to the **special toolkit** for building the **engine itself**. It provides a crucial, low-level command called `et` (Engine Tool) that the engine's own compilation scripts depend on to function. Simply put, without this path being set correctly, our compilation **will fail** later on.

Open shell profile file (`~/.zshrc`) in your editor and add the following lines. Adjust each `<PATH>` to match where you actually cloned or installed each tool.

```bash
# Open ~/.zshrc, add depot_tools to your PATH
export PATH="$HOME/depot_tools:$PATH"

# Flutter CLI (SDK)
export PATH="$HOME/flutter/bin:$PATH"

# Engine tool (et)
export PATH="$HOME/flutter/engine/src/flutter/bin:$PATH"

# Apply the PATH changes immediately
source ~/.zshrc

# Verify that gclient from depot_tools is in your PATH
which gclient

# Verify that the Flutter SDK is in your PATH
which flutter

# Verify that the engine tool (et) is in your PATH
which et
```

**Troubleshooting:** If you see a `command not found` error, it means your `PATH` is incorrect. Double-check the `export` lines in your `~/.zshrc` file for typos.

Phase 2: Syncing Engine Dependencies

### step4: gClient Dependency Bootstrap

Flutter engine uses `gclient` to manage dependencies.

Set up the `.gclient`¬† file in the repository root (the¬†repository root: `~/flutter` ), copy the standard gclient configuration file, and then run¬†`gclient sync`

```bash
# IMPORTANT: Navigate to the root of the flutter repository
cd ~/flutter

# Copy the standard gclient configuration file to the root
cp engine/scripts/standard.gclient .gclient
```

Run the following to sync dependencies:

```bash
gclient sync
```

Just a fair warning, the first time you run this, it takes forever (think 30-60+ mins) because it's downloading the whole world. So kick it off, go do something else, and come back later. After this initial one, it gets much faster.

Phase 3: Compiling the Engine

### step5: Compiling Flutter Engine (from `Compiling-the-engine.md`)

Choose Your Platform: [Compiling for iOS (from macOS)](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/engine/src/flutter/docs/contributing/Compiling-the-engine.md#compiling-for-ios-from-macos)

Build for iOS Device, iOS Simulator, and macOS Host

```bash
cd ~/flutter/engine/src

# Build iOS device-side executable
./flutter/tools/gn --ios --unoptimized
# Run build for iOS device version
ninja -C out/ios_debug_unopt

# For iOS simulator (on arm64 Mac), add --simulator and --simulator-cpu=arm64
./flutter/tools/gn --ios --simulator --unoptimized --simulator-cpu=arm64
# Run build for iOS simulator version 
ninja -C out/ios_debug_sim_unopt_arm64

#Build host-side tools with arm64 architecture to avoid Rosetta emulation
./flutter/tools/gn --unoptimized --mac-cpu arm64
# Run build for host-side tools version
ninja -C out/host_debug_unopt_arm64

```

### step6: Verify Engine Build Success

After building, you can verify if the outputs are generated by listing the folders:

```bash
ls out/
```

You should see the following folders:

- `ios_debug_unopt`
- `ios_debug_sim_unopt_arm64`
- `host_debug_unopt_arm64`

Phase 4: Integration and Verification

### step7: Prepare a Test Flutter App

```bash
mkdir ~/flutter-engine-tests
cd ~/flutter-engine-tests
flutter create myapp
cd myapp
```

Then you can use this app project to configure and run with your custom-built engine.

### step8: Configure and Run iOS Project via Xcode

To use your locally-built engine with the Flutter tool, pass the following two parameters:

`--local-engine-src-path`:Specifies the path to your engine repository.

`--local-engine`: Specifies which engine build to use (e.g., ios_debug_unopt, `host_debug_unopt`_arm64).

Typical invocation:

```bash
#Sets up the iOS project but does not build the app, and test on the real iphone
flutter build ios \
  --local-engine-src-path ~/flutter/engine/src \
  --local-engine-host=host_debug_unopt_arm64 \
  --local-engine=ios_debug_unopt \
  --config-only
  
# Explanation:
# --local-engine-src-path: Specifies the path to your engine repository's 'src' directory.
# --local-engine-host: Specifies the locally-built engine used by the Flutter tool itself (running on your macOS host).
# --local-engine: Specifies the locally-built engine that will be bundled with your app for the target device/simulator.

#Opens the project in Xcode for manual run/debug  
 open ios/Runner.xcworkspace

#Because --config-only only generates the Xcode project setup, 
#and open ios/Runner.xcworkspace lets you build and run manually in Xcode, 
#which is useful for debugging or stepping through engine code.

```

Phase 5: Debugging the Engine

### step9: Debug with Breakpoints

1. Open ios/Runner.xcworkspace in Xcode.
2. Set breakpoints in engine source code (e.g., FlutterTextInputPlugin.mm).
3. In Xcode, go to Debug > Attach to Process, then choose your app.
4. Run your Flutter app via `flutter run` or manually from Xcode.

This lets you step into engine code and inspect runtime behavior. 

üõ†Ô∏è Note: Source Code Shows Assembly?

Sometimes, when a breakpoint is hit, **Xcode may show assembly code** instead of the actual Flutter engine source file. This usually happens when Xcode cannot locate the correct source path.

To fix this:

- Make sure the **source path mapping** is active in your `~/.lldbinit` file.
- The actual path of your Flutter Engine source should **exactly match** the mapping.

You can add the following line to your `~/.lldbinit` file (update the path as needed):

```bash
settings set target.source-map "flutter/" "/path/to/engine/src/flutter/"
```

üí° Still seeing assembly even after setting the source-map?

Don't worry ‚Äî you're not alone. This issue can sometimes persist even with correct setup. If that happens, don't get frustrated!

You can try **manual LLDB debugging** as a workaround:

- Add a `NSLog()` or print statement in your Flutter engine source file to confirm your **custom local engine is actually running**.
- Use `lldb` in the terminal or via Xcode's debugger console to step through functions manually, even without full source mapping.

This way, you can still check if your local engine build is working, and see if your changes in the engine code are taking effect.

Appendix:

1. Network Proxy for Mainland China

If you are located in **mainland China**, you may encounter network issues when running `gclient sync` or accessing Google-hosted dependencies.

To avoid errors like `Connection timed out` or `Failed to fetch`, it is recommended to **temporarily set a proxy** in your terminal session before executing the installation steps.

```bash
# Set HTTP/HTTPS proxy for the current terminal session
export http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7890
export https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7890
export all_proxy=socks5://127.0.0.1:7890

```

Replace `127.0.0.1:7890` with your local proxy address (from Clash, Shadowsocks, V2Ray, etc.) You can also write this in your shell config (`~/.zshrc`) if you need it persistently.

1. (Optional) Flutter China Mirror Settings

For faster downloads of Dart/Flutter packages and SDK binaries in mainland China, you can point Flutter to a trusted mirror:

```bash
# Dart / Flutter package mirror
export PUB_HOSTED_URL="https://pub.flutter-io.cn"

# Flutter SDK & engine binary mirror
export FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL="https://storage.flutter-io.cn"
```

Add these to your shell profile (e.g. `~/.zshrc`) **before** step8. If you later experience missing-package errors, simply unset `PUB_HOSTED_URL` or comment it out and rerun your command
