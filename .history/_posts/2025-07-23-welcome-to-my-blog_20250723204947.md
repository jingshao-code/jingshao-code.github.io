Welcome to my new blog! This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts and experiences on machine learning, AI safety, and software engineering.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be covering:

- **Machine Learning Research**: Insights from my work on AI safety and multi-modal models
- **Technical Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides on ML implementations and tools
- **Project Updates**: Progress on my research and open-source contributions
- **Industry Insights**: Observations from my experiences in AI development

## Recent Work

I'm particularly excited to share more about my recent research on audio-based jailbreak attacks on Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) and my contributions to the Google Summer of Code 2025 project.

Stay tuned for more posts!
